## PR 10 — Dead code & micro-tidy

## Scope

* Remove unused helpers: `truthy?`.
* Remove leftover comments/method stubs related to removed builders.

## Rationale
Dead branches are complexity magnets.

## Patch

```diff
diff --git a/connector.rb b/connector.rb
@@
-    truthy?: lambda do |val|
-      case val
-      when TrueClass then true
-      when FalseClass then false
-      when Integer then val != 0
-      else
-        %w[true 1 yes y t].include?(val.to_s.strip.downcase)
-      end
-    end,
+    # (Removed) truthy? – unused
@@
-    # (Removed) build_gemini_payload – superseded by build_ai_payload templates
-    # (Removed) payload_for_ai_classify – unified into build_classify_payload
+    # Removed helpers migrated to unified builders
```

## Acceptance criteria

* No references to removed methods.
* Lint passes.

## Test plan

* Quick sweep: search for `truthy?` in repo; zero results.
* Smoke test core actions.
