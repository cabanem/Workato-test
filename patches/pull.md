1. Bug Fixes
   (a) Fixed typos and incorrect field names causing silent failures
   (b) Corrected API parameter formats (e.g., CamelCase for Google APIs)
   (c) Fixed variable naming inconsistencies
   (d) Added proper error handling for edge cases

2. Code Consolidation
   (a) Unified 5 duplicate Vertex action flows into a single run_vertex orchestrator
   (b) Simplified model discovery branching into a clean cascade pattern
   (c) Centralized Drive field definitions and change classification logic
   (d) Extracted common patterns into reusable components

3. Simplification
   (a) Removed incorrect local validations (let Vertex handle them server-side)
   (b) Standardized error handling and rate limiting across the codebase
   (c) Created reusable helpers for common patterns (JSON instructions, picklists, similarity calculations)
   (d) Consolidated scattered constants into centralized defaults

4. Cleanup
   (a) Removed dead code and unused functions
   (b) Pruned outdated comments
   (c) Pointed documentation to unified code paths
   (d) Verified no remaining references to removed code
